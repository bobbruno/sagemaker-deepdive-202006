In this section, we'll practice techniques for encapsulating and orchestrating the steps commonly required in Machine Learning Pipelines. A Machine Learning pipeline is a data transformation sequence of steps required for acquiring data, formatting it, engineering features and possibly sequencing many ML models as one integrated service. We'll practice the folowing techniques:
- Processing Jobs
- Step Functions
