The second example shows how to create a docker image containing [Dask](https://dask.org/) and run a transformation script using it on a cluster managed by SageMaker. The results will be used to train an XGBoost model. The provided code does all the configuration, and it can be reused by any job you may need.

Dask is a sophisticated processing framework which, among other interfaces, provides functionality similar to Pandas. The script provided uses a combination of Pandas and Dask processing, but any Dask interface is possible.
